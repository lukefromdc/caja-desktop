Surest way to build this is to get the git snapshot of GNOME/nautilus from April 26, 2016 
and replace main-desktop.c and nautilus-desktop-canvas-view.c with the files from this package,
then build Nautilus normally but do not install it. Nautilus itself must be already installed to
run this so alternately build from the original tarball, install, switch these files and build again.

Then go to nautilus/desktop/.libs and rename the nautilus-desktop binary caja-desktop. drop that into 
/usr/bin. /usr/local/bin or wherever you put out binaries, and the .desktop file into /etc/XDG/autostart.
Alternately load a .deb or RPM with the binary and the desktop file, then install it. 

In your mate session turn compositing ON , desktop icons in Nautilus/GNOME ON, and Caja's own desktop icons OFF. Enjoy icons on the desktop that work right with GTK 3.21.3 or later until the issue in Caja can be found and fixed right. This is
a WORKAROUND but it makes GTK 3.21.3 usuable in Caja for now.

To build against later versions of Nautilus, find the references to "mate" in the files and apply the code
changes bearing them to current Nautilus, then build. The version used must build nautilus-desktop as a 
separate binary. This change came AFTER the 3.20.0 release!
