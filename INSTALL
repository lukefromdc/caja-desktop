Surest way to build this is to get the git snapshot of GNOME/nautilus from June 24, 2016 
and replace main-desktop.c, nautilus-desktop-application.c and nautilus-desktop-canvas-view.c 
with the files from this package, then build Nautilus normally but do not install it.
Nautilus itself must be already installed to run this so alternately build from the original tarball, 
install, switch these files and build again.

Then go to nautilus/desktop/.libs and rename the nautilus-desktop binary caja-desktop. drop that into 
/usr/bin. /usr/local/bin or wherever you put out binaries, and the .desktop file into /etc/XDG/autostart.
Alternately load a .deb or RPM with the binary and the desktop file, then install it. 

In your mate session turn compositing ON and Caja's own desktop icons OFF. Enjoy icons on the desktop that 
work right with GTK3.21.3 or later until the issue in Caja can be found and fixed right. This is a WORKAROUND
but it makes GTK 3.21.3 usuable in Caja for now.

Note that nautilus master could change at any time, using a snapshot of master from today (6-24-2016) will 
guarantee a  sucessful build but the files modfied changed little sincnautilus-deskto was first split out of nautilus.

If using older Nautilus source. it must be from after the desktop split, which came after the release of 3.20.0.
